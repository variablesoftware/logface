# Commit Message Guidelines for Logface

- Use emojis to make commit messages fun and expressive (e.g., 🚂🎛️🧶⏮️📦😂😎).
- Follow [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) conventions (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`).
- Structure: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(core): Add wildcard log levels`).
- Keep messages concise and descriptive, using the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix").
- Reference issues or PRs when applicable (e.g., `fix: Resolve #123`).
- Avoid generic messages like "Update code" or "Fix bug".
- Write messages with future readers in mind.
- Use emojis sparingly to enhance clarity, not clutter.
