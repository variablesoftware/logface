# Code Generation Rules for Logface

- Modularize functions if they exceed 50-75 lines.
- Use Copilot for boilerplate code, utility functions, and type definitions.
- Avoid generating critical business logic without review.
- Ensure all generated code adheres to ESLint and TypeScript standards.
- Do not use Copilot for sensitive code like authentication or security logic.
- Generate corresponding tests for all new functions or modules.
